# Pointers
In C, pointers are used to save a variable's or memory location's address. Any data type, including int, char, function, array, or any other pointer, may be used for this variable. One of the fundamental ideas of the C programming language is the concept of pointers, which enables low-level memory access and dynamic memory allocation.
